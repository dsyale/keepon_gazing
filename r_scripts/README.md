#r_scripts
The R scripts here were used to analyze the data from the preliminary pilot rounds.

'post_columnnames.csv' gives the ordering of columns that was present in the data that was read into R.
'likert_analysis.R' read from a file named 'post.csv' in a directory on my local machine. Taking data from post survey questionnaires and 
putting them into a file with the same organization as post_columnnames.csv should allow that file to be read into and analyzed by the same scripts.
